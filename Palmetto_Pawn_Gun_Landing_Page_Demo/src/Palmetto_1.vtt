my name is james bryant 
i am a pawn broker at palmetto pawn and 
gun in hartsville south carolina 
i've been a pawn master customer for two 
years 
i think it's very thorough you know it's 
really easy to go in 
and uh complete a transaction on a c on 
a returning customer 
it's just i mean a few clicks and if 
especially if it's an item that they've 
pawned before 
i can go in and with just a few clicks i 
can have the customer out the door 
anytime that i've ever needed anything 
with um 
pawn master you guys have reached back 
out to me within minutes 
you know it's it's you know really good 
to know that you have somebody online 
for you 
well we had the wrong address 
in pawn master and i called and tried to 
get the address changed 
and it seemed like i was reaching a 
roadblock with the i.t guys 
so i messaged lynn 
on facebook and he reached out to me 
within 
minutes and got the ball rolling 
and it's pretty good when the ceo steps 
in 
gets the ball rolling and my problem got 
solved really quickly
